# Github Actions OpenMP troubleshooting
Ensures that OpenMP runs properly on Github Actions Ubuntu images/kernel online.
In C but intended for a Python/C++ project troubleshooting. See [this upstream issue](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/1465).

OpenMP C code comes from [this tutorial](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/exercise.html) by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

If a fix is found, [this G'MIC Python binding issue should become solved someday](https://github.com/myselfhimself/gmic-py/issues/47).
